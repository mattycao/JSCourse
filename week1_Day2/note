Object Oriented Programming
1. all object
   They are not alone, so they are connected.
   literal object and new constructor method, we can have initiate an object.

   CODE:
   obj = {
        name: 'rose',
        height: 159
   }
   This is object and it is singleton design pattern.
   We can assign all the related function and attribute in a single object, it like the static object in Java, or name space in C++

   实例识别
   面向对象的第一个任务：
    1. 解决生产的方式
2. Factory mode only produce the object type, we need an new way to produce the specific instance object.

3. The prototype mode
   CODE:
      function Shirt() {
        this.material = 'feng',
        this.height = 170
      }
   This will produce the Shirt Object if we use the new keyword.
   var shirt1 = new Shirt();
   1. This use the keyword new
   2. Produce an instance of the shirt object
   3. Based on the context of the new build object, run the Shirt function.
   4. It also initiate all of the attribute
   5.
