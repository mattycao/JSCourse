VARIABLE CLOSURE THIS
1. vital part in programming: the data
   like basic type, and object type
2. Assign the data with a variable name.
   The type of js variable is being effective when the value is assigned.
   So the variable type is the same with the data type.
3. Take an position, but not assign the space.
   Take an position and sit an space is not the same.
4. pre parse,
   CODE:
   alert(m)   //alert and console difference:
   var m = 9;
   fn();
   function fn() {}
5. Before the code is run, scan the code with the keyword var, then assign a space in the stack for the variable.
   At this time, the variable is no value, so is undefined.

   This is called declare.

   undefined is mark for un-exist.

   After the code is running, the system will give the data a space.

   Then link the variable with the data.

6. However, for the function,
   Before the code runs, scan all the function keyword, then declare the variable and assign the function value.
   This is called hoist.

SCOPE:
1. data also has privacy. JS don't has the block scope, it only has the function scope.
2. the pre-declare is declared in it own scope.
3. each evoking function will has it own scope, even they are the same function.

THE TOP SCOPE:
1. the top scope in JS -> Global
2. the proxy of top scope in the browser -> window || the proxy of top scope in the back-end in node -> process
3. Global's attribute

变量与属性的关系：
1. 全局变量是window的属性
2. window的属性也可以看做全局变量
3. 一个对象的属性，也可以看成是以这个对象为作用域下的变量 - with语句(not suggest, in with, if  you define variable with a var keyword, it will be a global var)

active object:
    for the function, the definition and the evoke is totally two different thing.
    The running of function is a life scope in the memory
    函数里面的变量，就在这个内存里面创建， 我们可以吧这个内存当做一个对象，而这个函数的变量就是这个对象的属性。

CLOSURE:
1. When to use it:
   Protect the variable
   maintain the asynchronous code

2. 形参： parameter 实参： argument
